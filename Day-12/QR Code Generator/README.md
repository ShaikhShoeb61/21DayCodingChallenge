## Description

This project is a result of my 21 days coding challenge, where I created a web-based QR code generator. Users can input text or a URL, and the application will generate a QR code that can be scanned to access the input content.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- QR code generation for text and URLs.
- Integration with a QR code generation API.
- Quick display of generated QR codes.


## Technologies Used

- HTML: Structure of the web page.
- CSS: Styling and layout.
- JavaScript: Handling user input and API integration.
- QR Code Generation API: Fetching and displaying QR codes.
- Fetch API: Communicating with the QR code generation service.


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Enter the text or URL for which you want to generate a QR code.
4. Click the "Generate QR Code" button.
5. The generated QR code will be displayed on the page.
