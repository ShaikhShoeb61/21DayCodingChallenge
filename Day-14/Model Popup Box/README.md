## Description

As part of my 21 days coding challenge, I created a popup discount feature with an email subscription form. This interactive component provides users with a discount offer, allows them to copy a coupon code, and enables them to subscribe by providing their email address.

## Features

- Eye-catching popup with a discount offer.
- Option to copy the coupon code to the clipboard.
- Email subscription form for users interested in updates.
- Smooth animations for a visually appealing experience.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Structure of the web page and form inputs.
- CSS: Styling and layout, including animations.
- JavaScript: Managing popup display, clipboard functionality, and random coupon code generate.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. The popup with the discount offer will appear after a brief delay.
4. Click the "Copy Coupon Code" button to copy the code to your clipboard.
5. Enter your email address in the subscription form if you wish to subscribe.
6. Click the "Subscribe" button to submit your email address.
