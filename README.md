# 21-Day Coding Challenge Projects

Welcome to my 21-Day Coding Challenge repository! Over the course of 21 days, I'll be taking on the challenge of creating a variety of projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Each project represents a step in my journey to improve my coding skills and create practical web applications.

## Projects

Each day, I'll be adding a new project to this repository. The projects will cover a range of topics and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Navigate to the specific project's directory.
3. Follow the project-specific README instructions to set up and run each project.
