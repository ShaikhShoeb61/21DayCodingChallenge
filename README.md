# 21-Day Coding Challenge Projects

Welcome to my 21-Day Coding Challenge repository! Over the course of 21 days, I've been taking on the challenge of creating a variety of projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Each project represents a step in my journey to improve my coding skills and create practical web applications.

## Projects

Each day, I've been adding a new project to this repository. The projects cover a range of topics and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Navigate to the specific project's directory.
3. Follow the project-specific README instructions to set up and run each project.

## Update

Due to health reasons, I had to pause the challenge after completing 10 days. However, I'm now back on track and excited to continue. I've pushed the code for the first 4 missed days and will soon push the remaining 7 days' code in a single commit.

Stay tuned for more updates and projects as I progress through the challenge!
