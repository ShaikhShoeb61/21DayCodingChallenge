## Description

This project is part of my 21 days coding challenge where I created a web page with a light mode and dark mode toggle button. Users can switch between two different color schemes to enhance their browsing experience.

## Features

- Light mode for a clean and bright interface.
- Dark mode for reduced eye strain during low-light conditions.
- Smooth transition animations between modes.


## Technologies Used

- HTML: Structure of the web page.
- CSS: Styling and animations.
- JavaScript: Handling the toggle functionality.


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Click the toggle button to switch between light mode and dark mode.



## Acknowledgments

- This project was inspired by my passion for design and front-end development.
- Thanks to online tutorials and resources for helping me learn and implement the toggle functionality.
