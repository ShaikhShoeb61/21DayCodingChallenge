# Dressify - Learning React Router DOM and React.js

Dressify is a React website created as part of my journey to learn React Router DOM and React.js. This project showcases my exploration of nested routes and UI designs.

## Learning Goals

- **React.js Concepts:**
  - fundamental React.js concepts.

## UI Designs

Dressify features a simple yet visually appealing design, with image galleries on each page highlighting different dress styles. The goal is to create an immersive experience for users exploring various fashion categories.
