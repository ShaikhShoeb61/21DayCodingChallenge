# Bubble Game
## Introduction

Welcome to the Bubble Game project, which is a part of my 21-day coding challenge. This game is developed during the second week of my JavaScript learning journey. I started by creating HTML and CSS projects in the first week and have now delved into JavaScript programming. This game is based on concepts I learned from the YouTube channel "Sheryians Coding School," particularly focusing on the topic of event bubbling.

## Project Details

- **Challenge Day:** 8
- **Week:** Second week of JavaScript
- **Source of Learning:** YouTube channel - Sheryians Coding School
- **Concepts Covered:** Event Bubbling in JavaScript

## About the Game

The Bubble Game is a simple yet engaging web-based game where players click on bubbles with numbers. The project involves dynamic bubble creation, a countdown timer, and a scoring mechanism. The main objective is to click on bubbles with numbers that match the displayed target number before the countdown timer reaches zero.

## Features

- Dynamic bubble creation with random numbers.
- Countdown timer to add excitement and urgency to the gameplay.
- Scoring system where players earn points for each correct click.
- Immediate feedback for correct and incorrect clicks.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in a web browser.
2. Bubbles with random numbers will appear on the screen.
3. The target number to match is displayed.
4. Click on bubbles with numbers that match the target number.
5. Each correct click earns you 10 points and spawns new bubbles.
6. If you click on a bubble with the wrong number, the game ends, and you can try again.
7. The countdown timer adds time pressure to the gameplay.
8. Restart the game at any time by clicking the "refresh button on browser.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Play the Bubble Game and challenge yourself to improve your score!
