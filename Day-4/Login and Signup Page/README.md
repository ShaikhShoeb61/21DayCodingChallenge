# Login and Signup Page with Glass Morphism Effect

Welcome to my Login and Signup Page project, part of my 21 Days Coding Challenge. In this project, I've created a user-friendly and visually appealing login and signup page using HTML and CSS. The design is enhanced with a glass morphism effect that gives the interface a sleek and modern look.

## Project Overview

This project showcases my skills in front-end development and UI design. I've implemented the following features:

- A login form that allows users to enter their username and password.
- A signup form for new users to create an account with a chosen username and password.
- Glass morphism effect applied to both the login and signup forms for a stylish and contemporary design.
- Responsive design to ensure a seamless experience on various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: To structure the web page and create the form elements.
- CSS: To style the page, apply the glass morphism effect, and make the design responsive.
