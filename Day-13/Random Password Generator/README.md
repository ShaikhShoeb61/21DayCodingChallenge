## Description

As part of my 21 days coding challenge, I developed a web-based random password generator. This tool allows users to create strong and secure passwords by just click on generate button and copy the password by using click on copy icon.

## Features

- Generates strong and randomized passwords for enhanced security.
- Clipboard integration for easy copying of generated passwords.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Click the "Generate Password" button.
4. The generated password will be displayed on the page.
5. Click the "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the password.
