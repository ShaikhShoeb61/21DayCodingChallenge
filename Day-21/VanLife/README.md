# VansLife - Van Renting Webapp

Welcome to VansLife, a web application for van renting services inspired by Scrimba's React Router dom course. This project is a result of my learning journey, and I've made UI enhancements inspired by the original.

- **Formik:** Enhances form management with Formik, simplifying form development and validation.

## UI Design

The UI design of VansLife is inspired by Scrimba's React Router project, with personalized color schemes from the original Scrimba Figma file. The goal is to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
